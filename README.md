# Example Procedure Debugging and Testing Code

Goal is to walk through creating an Eclipse project here shortly.

The long and short of it is to make a Java project with client and procedure directories as source folders.

Then add the junit jar from /lib, any jars from $VOLTDB_HOME/lib, and the main VoltDB jar from $VOLTDB_HOME/voltdb to the build path.

Then it may be helpful to add a log4j properties setting in your JVM file and you probably want to set the minimum heap to a gig or so.
